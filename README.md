<h1 align="center">Welcome to machine learning for Biomedical Engineering ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Here I upload some resources I used for the class I TA on spring 2021. Each topic has a code and a brief explanation of the topic.

## âœ¨ Unsupervised Learning

This code was used to teach clusting applications an unsupersed learning. In specific we apply k-means clustering. 

As a matter of example 3D random points were generated. Then, the values putted in a dataframe that was used for an unsupervised learning method.

### âœ¨ Some Advantages of Unsupervised Learning are

- Labeling of data demands a lot of manual work and expenses
- Finds patterns in data
- Dimensionality reduction
- Find what degree the data are similar
- Similar to human intelligence

### âœ¨ Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning

- Results less accurate without training data
- Model is learning from raw data without any prior knowledge
- The more the features, the more theÂ complexityÂ increases
