<h1 align="center">Welcome to machine learning for Biomedical Engineering ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Here I upload some resources I used for the class that I was teacher assisstant on spring 2021. Each topic has a code and a brief explanation of the topic.

## âœ¨ Machine Learning Model for MNIST Handwriting

This code was one of the first codes ued in class based on the book Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet.

In this code we used MNIST, a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. I explored the size and shape of the data. Some number were printed as images and as pixels values. Then, keras was used to built, train and predict a neural network with MNIST. Finally the accuracy was calculated.


### âœ¨ Some Advantages of Unsupervised Learning are

- Labeling of data demands a lot of manual work and expenses
- Finds patterns in data
- Dimensionality reduction
- Find what degree the data are similar
- Similar to human intelligence

### âœ¨ Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning

- Results less accurate without training data
- Model is learning from raw data without any prior knowledge
- The more the features, the more theÂ complexityÂ increases

## âœ¨ Unsupervised Learning using k-means

This code was used to teach clusting applications an unsupersed learning. In specific we apply k-means clustering. 

As a matter of example 3D random points were generated. Then, the values putted in a dataframe that was used for an unsupervised learning method.
